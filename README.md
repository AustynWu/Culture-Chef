# üç≤ Culture Chef Prototype

Culture Chef is a community-based web platform prototype that connects diners with home chefs offering authentic cultural meals.  
This version is a **static front-end prototype** created for demonstration purposes. It showcases the main use cases of the system without backend or database integration.

## üåè Project Background

Sydney is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, but many international students, migrants, and professionals struggle to access authentic cultural food.  
At the same time, many skilled home chefs lack a channel to share their cooking.  

Culture Chef addresses this gap by providing:

- A platform to **browse chefs** and their cultural dishes  
- A **reservation form** to book meals/events  
- Pages that highlight **cultural exchange and authenticity**

This prototype reflects our **group project proposal** (INFO6001/INFO7005 IT Project Management) and implements the **UI/UX concept** for the minimum viable product (MVP).
